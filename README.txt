Idamin Rahaman — Single-page Portfolio (GitHub Pages)
----------------------------------------------------

Files:
- index.html
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/scripts.js
- assets/Idamin_Rahaman_Resume.pdf  (embedded resume for direct download)

How to publish on GitHub Pages (simple):
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., idamin-portfolio).
2. Upload all files and folders (index.html and assets/) to the repository root.
3. Commit and push to the `main` (or `master`) branch.
4. In the repository Settings → Pages, choose the branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, then Save.
5. After a minute, your site will be available at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

Notes & tips:
- To change content, edit index.html directly (section texts are labeled).
- The Download Resume button is linked to assets/Idamin_Rahaman_Resume.pdf so it downloads directly.
- If you want a custom domain later, you can configure it in Settings → Pages.
